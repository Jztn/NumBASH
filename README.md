# NumBASH! - by Active!

NumBASH is a mobile phone enumeration tool that generates mobile prefixes for your desired area code.
Assuming you know the area code and the last 4 digits of someones phone number, this will generate
prefixes for the persons area code. You can then test social media forgot password forms with the 
generated numbers and see which ones exist to narrow down possibilities of the targets phone number.
